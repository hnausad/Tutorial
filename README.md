Q1. What are 4 OOPS principal in java?
### In Java, the **four main Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** are:

---

### **1. Encapsulation**
- **Definition:** Bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
- **Purpose:** To restrict direct access to some of an object's components, which is usually done using access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`).
- **Example:** Using getter and setter methods to access private variables.

---

### **2. Inheritance**
- **Definition:** Mechanism where one class (child/subclass) can inherit fields and methods from another class (parent/superclass).
- **Purpose:** Promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy.
- **Example:** `class Dog extends Animal {}`

---

### **3. Polymorphism**
- **Definition:** Ability of a single function, method, or operator to behave differently based on context.
- **Types:**
  - **Compile-time (Method Overloading)**
  - **Runtime (Method Overriding)**
- **Purpose:** To perform a single action in different ways.
- **Example:** Overriding the `toString()` method in a class.

---

### **4. Abstraction**
- **Definition:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
- **Achieved using:** 
  - **Abstract classes**
  - **Interfaces**
- **Purpose:** To reduce complexity and increase efficiency by focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it.
